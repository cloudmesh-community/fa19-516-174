1. I stay in a house in Bloomington, Indiana along with three other people.
2. The house is centrally air-conditioned.
3. The electricity usage has amounted to 0.36 metric tons of carbon emission.
4. Two international trips every year sum up to 7.50 metric tons.
5. I also travel approximately 20 miles a week by the city bus. The carbon emission here amounts to 0.01 metric tons.
6. Secondary activities such as buying food, electronics, furniture, etc, all sum up to 2.99 metric tons.
7. My carbon footprint is 10.85 metric tons, i.e., 23920.155lbs of carbon emission.

4. Recyclers
This can be desribed as a process of reusing materials that would otherwise simply go to waste, into useful products. In the context of datacenters, this implies resuing the energy that has been relased from it. This not only reduces costs, but also helps cut down on the carbon emissions. This energy recycling can be done in many forms, one of the most popular ones being reusing the heat from the hot aisles to warm nearby homes, offices, etc.[1]

One such example is Intel recycling the waste heat its datacenter produces, thus eliminating the need to use boilers to provide heating to the entire building and hot water throughout the entire year. This not only reduces the carbon emissions and energy usage, but also reduces costs drastically. These savings have been pegged at USD 235,000 annually. To recycle heat, the company employs the use of 'Heat Recovery Chillers (HR Chillers)'. The facilty has been designed and built to specifically accomodate this system from day-1. However, this posed a problem as the intial heat output from the datacenter would only bw 0.3 MW whereas the building requires 1.3 MW of heat energy. To accomodate this, they recover heat from offices, communication and meeting rooms and reuse it again as a part of the HR chilling system.[2]
