### E.Datacenter.3:

1. I stay in a house in Bloomington, Indiana along with three other people.
2. The house is centrally air-conditioned.
3. The electricity usage has amounted to 0.36 metric tons of carbon emission.
4. Two international trips every year sum up to 7.50 metric tons.
5. I also travel approximately 20 miles a week by the city bus. The carbon emission here amounts to 0.01 metric tons.
6. Secondary activities such as buying food, electronics, furniture, etc, all sum up to 2.99 metric tons.
7. My carbon footprint is 10.85 metric tons, i.e., 23920.155lbs of carbon emission.

4. Recyclers

This can be desribed as a process of reusing materials that would otherwise simply go to waste, into useful products. In the context of datacenters, this implies resuing the energy that has been relased from it. This not only reduces costs, but also helps cut down on the carbon emissions. This energy recycling can be done in many forms, one of the most popular ones being reusing the heat from the hot aisles to warm nearby homes, offices, etc.[1]

One such example is Intel recycling the waste heat its datacenter produces, thus eliminating the need to use boilers to provide heating to the entire building and hot water throughout the entire year. This not only reduces the carbon emissions and energy usage, but also reduces costs drastically. These savings have been pegged at USD 235,000 annually. To recycle heat, the company employs the use of 'Heat Recovery Chillers (HR Chillers)'. The facilty has been designed and built to specifically accomodate this system from day-1. However, this posed a problem as the intial heat output from the datacenter would only bw 0.3 MW whereas the building requires 1.3 MW of heat energy. To accomodate this, they recover heat from offices, communication and meeting rooms and reuse it again as a part of the HR chilling system.[2]

Efforts toward renewable energy and impacts within the society
The California state government has been putting in plenty of effort duing the last few decades to combat climate change and has been gravitating towards cleaner energy since then. Offering consumer rebates for intsalling and using wind and solar energy, passing a legislation to ensure that those who sell electricity increase their renewable energy purchases by at least one percent every year are some efforts made by the state to name a few.[3]

California now fulfills a huge part of its electricity needs from these renwable energy sources and aims to power atleast 50% of their energy needs from renewable sources by 2025 and increase this percentage to 60 by 2030 and eventually 100% by 2045. Since the generation of this kind of energy can get inconsistent, large-scale energy storage systems can be used to overcome this problem.[4]

While these efforts are going to pay off in the long term, the immediate impact on the society can have a detrimental affect. The people in the state are already paying 50% over the national average for electricity. This aggressive shift towards green sources can end up being expensive as well. Irregular generation of energy means that this excess energy would have to be stored for future use. In another scenario, if no energy is generated at all, they would need to have oil or natural gas based power plants on standby for such emergencies. However, the public at large still does support these policies while probably not fully understanding the consequences.[5]


### E.Datacenter.8:

A major datacenter outage that happened was in Sydney. It affected most of the services in Australia and life was almost brought to a standstill.
1. Date: June 2016
2. Datacenter: AWS
3. Category: Severe Weather
4. Description: Storms led to a power outage and eventually failure of service instances.
5. Duration: 10 hours
6. Impact: Severe
A large number of businesses were affected by this datacenter outage. Some of the big names include Domino's Pizza, Foxtel, Westpac, Bank of Queensland, Me Bank, IMB Bank, etc. 
While some recovered quick enough, banking services were disrupted and bank cards couldn't be used temporarily. This led to a major part of the citizens lives coming to a standstill as they were unable to pay for any services provided.[6]
The online services disrupted include food delivery and streaming services as well.
